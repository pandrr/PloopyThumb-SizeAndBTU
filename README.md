# PloopyThumb-SizeAndBTU
BTU and size Mods for the Ploopy Thumb trackball

## Disclaimer
Top and bottom shell are both needed, because there are cutouts in the bottom part to fit the BTUs.

The intended BTUs for use are Bosch Rexroth R053010810 KU-B8-OFK.  
Three are needed and I've sourced them from here https://keycapsss.com/BOSCH-Rexroth-BTU-Ball-transfer-units-R053010810-KU-B8-OFK/KC10246  

## Printsettings

3D Print settings (on Bambulab X1C, but should be good on any other modern 3DP):  
0.12 layer height  
15% infill  
3 walls  
Treesupports  
32° for supports  

I've used Bambulabs PLA Matte and with the settings above the shell feels more like it was injection molded with a slight texture to it.  
Printtime, with these settings (for the small shell) were about 3.5h for the top part and 1.5h for the bottom part.
